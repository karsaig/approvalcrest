 * Java agent that hands approvalcrest an {@link Instrumentation} instance, so that safe mode can

 * <p>
 * Attach it at JVM startup:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * -javaagent:/path/to/approvalcrest-agent.jar
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * From JDK 26 the {@code sun.misc.Unsafe} memory-access methods throw by default, which is what
 * safe mode previously used to open modules. {@code Instrumentation.redefineModule} is the
 * supported replacement, and an agent is the only way to obtain an {@code Instrumentation}.
 * Attaching at startup is unaffected by JEP 451, which restricts dynamic attach only.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Without this agent nothing breaks: approvalcrest falls back to the Unsafe route where it still
 * works, and to getter-based serialization where it does not.
