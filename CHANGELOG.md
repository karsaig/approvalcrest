Version 0.60.0 - 2021/04/18
-----

- Upgrade JUnit to latest versions and make them provided dependencies, so it is easier to use with different versions
- JUnit 5 modules require JUnit 5.7.0+ now
- **Non-backward compatible change!** Added automatic sorting of field names, so the approved files and diff view will display fields in natural order.
Without this there were changes on pull requests without any reason. Only the serialization order have changed.
Doesn't affect constructs where order matters (example: Lists). This sorting is enabled by default and will fail assertions when approved file isn't sorted. 
  Anyone wants to revert to **old behaviour**, use **"-DsortInputFile=true"**
  This was done in order to avoid above mentioned noise on pull requests, and extending the migration and adding this noise to many pull request.
  
- Added support for sorting parts of json files, so collections which aren't sorted by default, and could have caused flaky tests due to non-deterministic ordering, can now be sorted to stabilize tests. When in use the approved file also have to be sorted, but can be switched with **"-DsortInputFile=true"**
- Fixed many bugs related to not working ignores, jsonMatcher not working for String containing json correctly, same matcher for different inputs working differently, assert failures sometimes missing description and actual / expected content.
- **Non-backward compatible change!** Ignored values should no longer be visible in approved files. It is backward compatible for some of the ignores, but not all, so approved files have to updated.
- Unified how assertions for JUnit 4 and 5 work, so there shouldn't be any difference between the two.
  This means JUnit 5 assertion errors won't contain the whole actual / expected content in the descriptions, those are already in the exception supported by major IDEs.
  Description will contain the difference only.
- Added additional convenience method for some ignores
- **Non-backward compatible change!** Up until now, asserting exceptions ignored the exception type, it is now added to the serialized format and asserted. 
Stacktrace in exceptions are automatically ignored from now on, as that caused frequent test failures without ignores, forcing everyone to add ignore in many places.
- Extended support for floating point numbers.
- Fixed a bug where files and directories could have wrong permissions in some cases
- Preliminary Kotlin support.
